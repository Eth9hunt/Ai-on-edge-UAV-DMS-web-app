### **Notes on the README.md**
- **Markdown Formatting**: The file uses Markdown syntax for headings (`#`, `##`), lists, code blocks (```), and links. GitHub will render this as a clean, readable webpage.
- **Structure**: The description includes sections for overview, features, prerequisites, setup instructions, technologies, files, contributing guidelines, license, and acknowledgments, making it comprehensive for users and developers.
- **Customization**: Replace `YOUR_SCRIPT_ID` in the setup instructions with your actual Google Apps Script URL. You can also customize the license, acknowledgments, or add more sections (e.g., screenshots, demo video) as needed.
- **Placement**: Save this as `README.md` in your project folder, commit it to Git, and push it to your GitHub repository as described in the previous GitHub repository creation guide.

This `README.md` provides a professional and detailed description of your project, making it easy for others to understand, set up, and contribute to your "AI on Edge Real-time Disaster Management System." Let me know if you want to adjust any section or add more details!
